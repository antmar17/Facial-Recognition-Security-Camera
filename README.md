# Facial-Recognition-Security-Camera
Just a toy project to dive into some facial recognition! A Security Camera that registers faces, and sends an email to a designated user if it finds a face it doesn't recognize. Probably going to try to implment some of these ideas into a rasberry pi so that I can use it in a drone or something who knows
